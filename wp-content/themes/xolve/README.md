Xolve Wordpress Base Theme
===

This is the core Wordpress theme for Xolve Inc, it is based on the underscores theme (underscores.me), and includes the following features:

* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A sample custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found in the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.
